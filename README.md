This is a simple side scroller game created with Unity. 
The goal of the game is to avoid the obstacles ad make it through all three levels.

This was great practice with C# and I learned how to implement physics in my game, 
as well and create moving objects and add animation to my game objects.

The WebGL build is available to play at https://elangeni.itch.io/platformer
